## Settings Swipe - your iOS settings where they should be, right at your finger tips.

---

##Install

Works right out of the box, just download/clone and run. (You may want to add your own nice app icon though)

##To use

1. Once launched simply choose which settings shortcuts you want to have added to your local notification centre.
2. Hit save.
3. No step 3. Shortcuts can now be accessed from anywhere by swiping down.

You may have to adjust the number of notifications that your device can show from within your device settings. Default is 5 and the maximum you
can display is 10. I like to re-order the notifications so this app is at the top.

I had already localised the settings names for the original app into French, German, Italian and Spanish, so I've included them all in this project.

**Note** - The notifications won't keep appearing at the top of your screen when you set them and will be available until you clear them.

I've not yet upgraded to the latest 5.0 betas, but I'm told that these shortcuts will **no longer work** in future firmware releases.

##History

My latest app, [App Swipe](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/app-swipe/id482494990?mt=8&partnerId=30&siteID=BcMBY/pRbWY), started out as the code you see here. Originally when iOS5 settings shortcuts 
were made available I wanted a simple way to use them on my device. The only way I found described on line was using bookmarks, or setting a custom homescreen icon with the data url.
At first I didn't think that it would be a problem using notifications for shortcuts, its a natural fit for quickly adjusting brightness or toggling wifi/bluetooth
and something I know Android users have had for a while (and something been available in the jailbreak world for ever) but unfortunately the app was rejected as the 'prefs' url scheme that is used
to launch settings directly is a private url scheme.
I won't go into the whole 2 month process of getting App Swipe approved, suffice to say it is now live and plays by the rules.
I hope you find this project useful but I wouldn't recommend submitting to the AppStore :)

This app has a shortcut to App Swipe added on the main view controller, i'd be most grateful if you checked it out, or told your friends about it.
Whilst not having local notifications it does allow custom shortcuts for mail, iMessage, Twitter etc and includes an interesting 'worldwide custom URL trends' feature which I hope
will ultimately make more people aware of the cool things that custom URLs can do.

Happy swiping, 
Nik
